# ImageX Project

imageX is envisioned as an image exchanging platform that photographers can upload a portfolio of quality images and make them available for commercial and non-commercial use freely. Full-size image files may be downloaded from the platform and used for any purpose free of charge. In return, photographers can raise their profile and gain exposure to potential clients.
